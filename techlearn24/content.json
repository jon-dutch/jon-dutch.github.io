In the live demo the rep managed to create a training badge in about 1-minute, complete with a quiz, graphics, OpenBadge API, etc... Everything! About a minute. Was really impressive and, as it is XML based, it can be integrated into most any platform, like Intellum, for instance�</p> <div class=\"ref-link\"><a href=\"https://tinyaward.com/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f\" class=\"ref-link\">TinyAward.com</a></div>"

Something happened with Calendly and it took my 9a time slot and turned it into an 8a time slot. Waiting for that to be fixed.

I appreciated that and I am hoping to learn more from her in the coming days. </p><p>She also suggested the fictional <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/4c9ZKaFtEKweSYOlYvxfvp\">Case 63</a> podcast as a good listen.</p><div class=\"ref-link\"><a href=\"https://ifyouaskbetty.com/\" style=\"font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;\">ifyouaskbetty</a></div>�"

      "text": "<p>This was the first \"real\" session I attended and after this one I felt like it had already paid for the cost of admission in some ways. Jeff Batts is a Learning Experience Designer (I feel like I see a new job title in my future) for Amazon. He also created the page linked below, the <strong>Learning Dojo</strong>, where he offers various learning technology trainings.</p><p>The topic he discussed and provided resources for at the conference was using JavaScript (JS) snippets in Articulate. This mostly centered around animating different elements, and he does this by making use of the same JS library that Articulate uses: <a href=\"https://gsap.com/\" >GSAP</a>. This is a very similar approach to the one I took in hacking our Tembo courses.<br> Jeff created a webpage (using AI) that hosts a number of <a href=\"https://learningdojo.ninja/javascript-snippets/\">premade JS snippets</a> that can be easily used in Storyline (and other locations). He has also outlined any variables that need to be created, and fields that can be edited to suit your needs.

      "text": "<p>This was an insightful overlay of Generative AI, as it pertains to the learning sector as well as the world writ large. I do feel I would be doing a bit of an injustice of trying to distill things down here, but the gist of it was that AI is here to stay and we will be better positioned if we accept this and move forward from that footing as opposed to battling with the entire idea in our heads. AI was a persistent and consistent theme and the whole conference, and I avoided most of those sessions, except for one. At the end of the day, we are beholden to MSF's wills and desires on the topic, but I do feel better equipped to have a more focused conversation on the topic. Additionally, she wrote a book about the whole thing (Amazon link below).</p><div class=\"ref-link\"><a href=\"https://a.co/d/8aOxiCQ\">Generative AI and Education: Digital Pedagogies, Teaching Innovation and Learning Design</a></div>"

      "text": "<p>Another interactive session focused on creating accessible courses. The interactive component mostly revolved around a deck of custom cards (I have a set) where you choose a scenario and a character. The idea being, as a group, talk out how you would meet the needs of the scenario for the character you�ve drawn. As a group you talk through things in the hopes of collectively finding solutions. One of the pairings we had that stumped us, as an example, was:</p><ul><li><strong>Scenario:</strong> Develop a training media library</li><li><strong>Character:</strong> Nick who is autistic</li></ul><p>This pairing resulted in a pretty contradictory conversation in our group as we had two different points of reference among the group. One participant has a family member who doesn�t like videos at all, so they would never watch anything in the library, but they may read � so including transcripts was one solution. Another participant has a family member who loves watching videos but would not watch anything longer than roughly 1 minute in length. It�s fair to say we didn�t come up with a solution for that one, but as with the WoW, the strength was all in the conversations.</p><p>In addition to the card game, the presenter also referenced a number of different guidelines and tools. I have outlined them in the resource section. </p><div class=\"ref-link\"><a href=\"https://courses.artisanlearning.com/clients/Demo/AL-WCAG/index.html#/\">Artisan Learning</a></div>"

      "text": "<p>This class was AWESOME!!! If anything, I may have taken too many notes! I have a bunch of links in the resource section � mostly book titles � that relate to this session. As awesome as this session was, it did leave a number of asking some questions regarding our ethical role in delivering learning. Let me explain.</p><p>The gist of this class is that everyone is combating some form of digital dependency. It is a fact of life. This can result in adult learners being distracted, lacking adequate attention spans, forgetting things, etc� The two conditions that were discussed are: <a href=\"https://www.neurocenternj.com/blog/digital-dementia-how-screens-and-digital-devices-impact-memory/\">Digital-Dementia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.psu.edu/news/impact/story/digital-amnesia\"> Digital-Amnesia</a>. Both are components of a larger reliance on digital devices and have resulted in actual neurological changes in the brain. We are, in essence, rewiring our brains to be dumber because the devices in our pockets have all the answers, so why bother thinking or remembering anything anymore. Dopamine rush, please!!!</p><br><p>The quandary this left many of us in, was: <strong>what does this mean for those of us delivering learning?</strong></p><br><p>Those presenting on the topic were of the mind that we need to acknowledge the world as it is and deliver content in a way that aligns with these issues. Leaning into the problem, as it were. Many of us, hoever, felt a moral obligation to aide our colleagues in course correcting. Putting down their devices and rewiring their brains back to the original Operating Systems.

      "text": "<p>I think Jessica would have appreciated this one the most. Mona is a highly intelligent person who looks at massive datasets, processes them, pulls out information in an attempt to frame them, and then hand-draws graphics to visualize them. Not liking the word \\�infographic\\� Mona prefers to take a more humanized approach to representing data. Her drawings are fun, rough around the edges, colorful and, most of all, they tell a story that people can understand. I highly encourage you to look through the samples on her website and I would be very happy to talk to anyone about instituting a similar approach in the WoW!</p><div class=\"ref-link\"><a href=\"https://monachalabi.com/\">Mona Chalabi</a></div>�"

      "text": "<p>This was an informative and fun session, albeit not without its hiccups. The difference between Gamification and Game Play was clearly made at the start of the session. You can view the presentation, <a href=\"https://qrfy.io/api/storage/gcs/pdf/qrfyprod/d3d4af8d-329d-45b4-a29d-9d296362cdfd.pdf\">here</a>, if you are interested (I have linked in the resources section, as well).</p><p>Once the theory portion was over we broke up into teams to play the <a href=\"https://playkairos.com/bottleneck-challenge/\">�Bottleneck Challenge�</a> game. One team was setup to play a physical version of the game, while everyone else was set to play the game digitally via their phones. Digital was not without it�s challenges, however, and I was on one of a few teams where this did not go very smoothly. Fortunately, he had brought a few other versions of the physical game so we could play at our table. It was good, and we genuinely did learn things!</p><div class=\"ref-link\"><a href=\"https://blueskylearning.in/\">Blue Sky Learning</a></div>�"

      "text": "<p>This was a good session that I didn�t really take any notes on. The crux of the session is there appears to be diminishing rates of critical thinking skills in the workplace. One example that hit home for me was getting a question from a colleague that you probably shouldn�t have received in the first place. The speaker said she does what I often do and copy/pasted the question into Google and sent that to the asker of said question (the speaker actually send the link to the Google search, as opposed to the first result like I do � Sassy!). We discussed the multitude of reasons someone may refuse to look for answers themselves, and tried to unpack all the different angles someone may be approaching aproblem from. This was a very discussion oriented session, hence the lack of notes, but I really enjoyed it, too.</p><p>Like other courses, this topic had two sides to it: lean into this and deliver more easily digested information, or course-correct and attempt to reinforce critical thinking skills in your trainings.</p><div class=\"ref-link\"><a href=\"https://nursing.vanderbilt.edu/\">Vanderbilt University School of Nursing</a></div>�"

      "text": "<p>Probably my favorite session � and it even had to do with AI. Figure that one out, those following along at home! As much eye-rolling as I did at every mention of <em>\\�AI\\�</em>, this session really spoke to me and got me excited.</p><p>The speaker made a point that the AI they were using in this presentation was ChatGPT and in no way similar to the new AI features that Articulate recently rolled out. Those features are mostly around using AI to more quickly create courses. What this session as about was so much bigger than that.</p><p>I truly do not know where to begin here, but I think this can most easily be summed up by may favorite example use-case of the tool: AI driven simulations.</p><p>Imagine, if you will, we have learners doing their pre-work (already amazing to consider) for \\�Difficult Conversations\\� and they come across an activity where they are supposed to have a conversation with a colleague about something difficult� and that is exactly what they do. They open the conversation with the colleague from within Storyline in a space that looks very reminiscent of a text chat window. They type what they want to say and hit �Send�. They get a response from the �colleague�. An actual response, not a scripted one. They have this conversation with a few exchanges back and forth to get a feel for how such a conversation may go. Every time they attempt this part of the pre-work they have a completely unique and new experience. I�ll let that sink in.</p><p>There was more that could be done, as well, but that one really hit home for me. We could possibly deploy something similar with the help of the MSF AI platform and team.</p><p>Here is a presentation the created on <a href=\"https://arthademos.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/speak-AI-fluently/index.html#/\">Prompt Engineering</a>.</p><div class=\"ref-link\"><a href=\"https://arthalearning.com/\">Artha Learning Inc.</a></div>�"
